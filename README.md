# `db_public` - DataBooth's public repository

Welcome! :)

_Coming soon_ - this is the placeholder location for sharing of public materials by [DataBooth](https://www.databooth.com.au).

We are almost exclusively a Python and SQL shop. Some of the components that we are experimenting with currently: 

- [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org) a fast in-process analytical database
- [`sqlglot'](https://sqlglot.com) a no-dependency SQL parser, transpiler, optimiser, and engine
- [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org) an open-source scientific and technical publishing system together with `Jupyter`

among many others.
