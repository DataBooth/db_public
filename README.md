# `db_public` - DataBooth's public repository

Welcome! :)

_Coming soon_ - this is the placeholder location for sharing of public materials by [DataBooth](https://www.databooth.com.au).

We are almost exclusively a Python and SQL shop. Some of the open source components that we are using or experimenting with currently: 

- [`DuckDB`](https://duckdb.org) a fast in-process analytical database
- [`sqlglot`](https://sqlglot.com) a no-dependency SQL parser, transpiler, optimiser, and engine
- [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org) an open-source scientific and technical publishing system together with `Jupyter`
- [`dbt`](https://www.getdbt.com) a SQL-first transformation workflow for creating data pipelines with a modern safety-net
- [`Prefect`](https://www.prefect.io) is an orchestration tool for building, observing, and reacting to your workflows.

among many others.
